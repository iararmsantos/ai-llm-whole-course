    "#### LLM comes in 3 flavors\n",
    "  - Base Model: get input and predicts what comes next\n",
    "  - Chat/Instruct Model: have a specific structure where it get a question and the model answer it\n",
    "    - Better for interactive use cases and creative content(?) generation\n",
    "  - Reasoning/Thinking: reason about the answer, decide how much reasoning, GPT has this flavor as well, so it is called hybrid.     \n",
    "    - Budget forcing: You can add the word wait in the middle of the sequence then it wil make it to reasoning more\n",
