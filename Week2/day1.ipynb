       "Here is the step-by-step explanation:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Visualize the Books:** The two volumes are standing side by side in their correct order. Volume 1 is on the left, and Volume 2 is on the right.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Identify the Covers:**\n",

       "    *   In the middle, the **back cover of Volume 1** is touching the **front cover of Volume 2**.\n",
       "    *   On the far right is the back cover of Volume 2.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Pinpoint the Worm's Path (The Trick):**\n",
       "    *   The worm starts at the **first page of Volume 1**. A book's first page is just inside its front cover. Since Volume 1 is on the left, its front cover is the leftmost part of the book. Therefore, the first page of Volume 1 is physically located right next to the cover that is touching Volume 2.\n",
       "    *   The worm ends at the **last page of Volume 2**. A book's last page is just inside its back cover. Since Volume 2 is on the right, its back cover is the rightmost part of the book. Therefore, the last page of Volume 2 is also physically located right next to the cover that is touching Volume 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Calculate the Distance:**\n",
       "    The worm doesn't need to chew through the pages of either volume. Its path is very short. It gnaws through:\n",
       "    *   The back cover of Volume 1 (2 mm)\n",
       "    *   The front cover of Volume 2 (2 mm)\n",

       "   - If you can communicate, build reputation, or expect future interactions, cooperating (sharing) can be the best long‑term strategy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Because the question asks you to **pick one** without additional context (e.g., repeated rounds, reputation effects), many people opt for the *dominant* self‑interested move (“Steal”). However, if you value **mutual benefit** and assume the other contestant might also be inclined to cooperate, “Share” is the choice that guarantees you a positive payoff and avoids the worst‑case outcome of both getting nothing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Given the wording “Do you choose to Steal or Share? Pick one,” the safest answer that **maximizes your guaranteed earnings**—assuming the other player could also be rational and might think the same way—is **Share**.
